### Neural TicTacToe

Hey there! This small project is a simple tic tac toe game,
but with an AI, that is powered by a neural network, based on [synaptic.js](https://synaptic.juancazala.com).

It is running fully client sided and may only work on newer browsers.

### Install

To install this game on your machine and play around with the code, clone
the repository and run the `install.sh` script.

To build the javascript run `build.sh`.

### Try online

The project can be found on GitHub Pages [here](https://maltebartels.github.io/Neural-TicTacToe).

### Warning:

Currently, the AI is quite dumb... workin' on it.
